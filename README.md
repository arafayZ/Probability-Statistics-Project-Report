# Probability-Statistics-Project-Report


A Python-based project that implements core concepts of Probability & Statistics through practical computation, hypothesis testing, and graphical visualization. This project bridges statistical theory with real-world data analysis using interactive inputs and clear outputs.

# 📌 Project Overview
1. This repository contains Python programs for:
2. Computing Confidence Intervals
3. Performing Hypothesis Testing
4. Visualizing statistical distributions and results
5. The project supports both manual user input and Excel file uploads, making it flexible for academic and practical use.

#🔍 Features

✅ Confidence Interval for:
Population Mean
Population Variance
Population Standard Deviation

✅ Hypothesis Testing for:
Population Mean (Z-test / T-test)
Population Variance (Chi-square test)
Population Standard Deviation

📈 Graphical visualization using probability distributions

📂 Input via manual entry or Excel files

🧮 Clear statistical interpretation (p-values, test statistics, decision rules)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
SciPy
Matplotlib
Google Colab (optional)

#📂 Input Methods
The programs allow:
Manual Input – Enter sample statistics directly
Excel Upload – Upload a .xlsx file containing sample data (single or two columns depending on the test)

#📊 Statistical Concepts Implemented
Confidence Level & Margin of Error
Z-distribution & T-distribution
Chi-square distribution
One-tailed & Two-tailed tests
p-value based decision making

#▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/probability-statistics-python.git
